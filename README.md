# Repository that contains students' work for the Data structure course 2020/2021
### Structure:
* group1 - contains code for the students that belong to group 1
* group4 - contains code for the students that belong to group 4

### Rules:
1. **master** branch is protected so every change must be made through pull request.
2. Students should touch only their folders
3. When opening PR, it should contain summary of the problems that are being solved. If a student tries to add solution to a problem that is not in this repository, task description must be provided.
